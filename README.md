## 🛠 Why LogVault?
Most log management tools are either "too big to fail" enterprise behemoths or bare-bones CLI scripts. **LogVault** bridges the gap. It is a focused, intelligent, and forensic-grade log vault for environments where every second of history matters.

## ✨ Features that Wow

### 🛰️ The "Blackbox" Flash-Archive (USB Sync)
LogVault acts like a **Flight Recorder** for your infrastructure. Enable "Auto-Sync" to mirror every incoming log message directly to an external USB drive in real-time. 
- **Forensic Ready:** Even if the server is compromised or the database wiped, your logs are safe on the physical "Blackbox" drive.
- **Offline Analytics:** Move the drive to any machine for air-gapped forensic analysis.

### 🧠 Zero-Knowledge AI Intelligence
Connect your choice of **OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral**, or even a **Local LLM (Ollama)**. LogVault interpret logs in real-time, providing deep security insights and suggested patterns without compromising your privacy.

### 🎨 Premium "Glass" Aesthetics
Built for developers who care about design. A fully responsive, vibrant, glassmorphic interface that feels more like a command center than a dashboard.

### 🛰️ Native Syslog Ingestion
Universal compatibility. Ingest logs from servers, gateways, IoT devices, or web apps. LogVault acts as a central hub for your entire infrastructure.

### 🔔 Smart Webhook Alarms
Get notified where it matters. Configure smart alarms that fire based on AI-determined severity levels, sent directly to Slack, Discord, or any custom webhook.

## 🐳 Deployment

      - "514:5140/udp"
    environment:

## 💾 Backup & Persistence

LogVault uses SQLite for simplicity and high performance. Your data is protected through Docker volumes.

### Data Persistence
Base configurations and logs are stored in a Docker volume `sqlite_data`. This ensures your data survives container updates and restarts.

### Manual Backup
To create a manual snapshot of your database, run:
```bash
docker cp log-tool:/app/prisma/prod.db ./backup_logvault_$(date +%F).db
```

To restore a backup, simply copy it back to the volume or replace the file in your mounted directory.
